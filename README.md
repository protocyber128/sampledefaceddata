# sampledefaceddata
Attached is a small set of sample defaced and non-defaced data.  You can segregate the data for your own training and testing datasets.  

Can you develop a classification engine to classify if a new webpage is defaced or non-defaced?   

You can consider using one of the approaches:
1. Deep learning NLP classification methods eg. Naive Bayes
2. Deep learning Computer Vision classification methods eg. CNN

The classification engine should be developed in either tensorflow/keras (prefered) or pytorch.  You can use Google colab for temp GPU resources.

Due to the limited datasize, we are not expecting super high accuracy.  We are more interested in understanding your thought process and your development skills in deep learning.  

You will get a chance to go through your model with us in the next interview.  

All the best!
