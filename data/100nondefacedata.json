Noble Houses of AndorBy LindaAndor is one of the largest and longest established of the New Era nations:Its sovereignty dates from Artur Hawkwing\u2019s death at the onset of the War of the Hundred Years before which it was a province under Hawkwing\u2019s governor Endara Casalain The Royal Line can actually trace its rule of the area to a time before Hawkwing for Endara was the daughter of Joal Ramedar the last King of Aldeshar before Hawkwing\u2019s conquest Upon the death of the High King the governor\u2019s daughter Ishara joined with his greatest general Souran Maravaile to take control of the province from her mother and make it a nation Ishara became the first Queen of Andor and the blood of her line has been decisive in determining all subsequent successions The World of Robert Jordan\u2019s The Wheel of TimeNote however that Aldeshar has nothing to do with the part of eastern Andor seized by Ishara although Ishara was native to the province which is why she became Queen rather than Souran King according to The Wheel of Time Companion Interestingly history is currently repeating itself: a noble darkskinned invader with a militarily brilliant commoner husband has taken over remnants of the Hawkwing empire\u2026 Andoran monarchs base their claim to the throne on descent from a noble and a commoner When Elenia tells Rand:Endara resigned her warrant and knelt to Ishara as Queen Somehow Rand did not believe it had happened quite that way or so smoothly Lord of Chaos Connecting Lineshis dry comment increases suspicions that Ishara and Souran seized Andor by forceIshara\u2019s marriage with Maravaile was an important factor in steering Andor through the chaos of the War of the Hundred Years:Many historians believe that it was these needs that motivated her to marry Souran Maravaile for he was Hawkwing\u2019s finest general and a brilliant military strategist Others believe that love must have played at least a small role since for all his abilities Souran was only a commoner while she was of royal blood They argue that she would have had to love him to marry so far beneath her station Souran was commanding the siege of Tar Valon at the time of Hawkwing\u2019s death and for almost a year after Many believe that he had to love Ishara to be willing to break the siege at her request after having held it so long Whether or not love was involved Ishara knew she needed both Maravaile\u2019s army and the White Tower\u2019s goodwill Marrying Souran gave her the first sending her eldest daughter to study in the Tower gained her the second as well as an Aes Sedai advisor named Ballair She was the first ruler to have an Aes Sedai advisor The World of Robert Jordan\u2019s The Wheel of TimeActually the Tower\u2019s singular favour to Andor in allowing the heir to be trained in the Tower and effectively made honorary Accepted was probably an acknowledgement of a debt to Ishara in convincing Souran to remove his besieging forces from Tar Valon to go carve a nation for themselves Ishara had Souran secure the land around Caemlyn first and then slowly expand their control It took five years before their lands stretched to the River Erinin Lord of Chaos Connecting LinesSouran Maravaile was killed by four swordsmen assassins in the twentythird year of the War of the Hundred Years although he managed to kill them in turn Lord of Chaos Lion on the Hill Ishara reigned from FY 994\u20131020 in a time of constant military conflict and decisions made in her reign became law in the reigns that followed:The most widely known tradition of Andor is that only a Queen may sit upon the Lion Throne and wear the Rose Crown never a king This initially arose when none of the royal sons survived the War of the Hundred Years but eventually became law The eldest daughter is named DaughterHeir By law she is first sent to the Tower to study then ascends the throne upon her mother\u2019s death or retirement The World of Robert Jordan\u2019s The Wheel of TimeThe Daughter Heir is presented with the ring by the Tower whether or not she can channel in recognition of Andor\u2019s long support of the Tower The Fires of Heaven Memories And as a reminder of the Tower\u2019s long support of AndorHer eldest brother styled First Prince of the Sword is sworn to protect and defend his sister with his life The First Prince is trained from childhood to command the Queen\u2019s armies in times of war and to be her military advisor If the Queen has no surviving brother she appoints the First PrinceWhen there is no surviving daughter the throne is given to the nearest female blood relative Succession is based not just on close relation to the former Queen but on the degree of blood in matrilineal descent from Ishara Such matters of lineage have become quite complex since all the Great Houses are related after years of intermarriage and the question of succession has led to bloodshed when the Houses do not agree These conflicts are known outside of Andor as the Andoran Wars of Succession Andorans simply refer to them as \u201cdisturbances\u201d refusing to acknowledge that their system for selecting an heir could possibly lead to war There have been three wars for succession in Andor The World of Robert Jordan\u2019s The Wheel of TimeElayne\u2019s struggle for the throne arguably makes a fourth The chart below lists the known Andoran Queens and show the Free Years era nations that gave birth to Andor the first nine Queens are listed in The World of Robert Jordan\u2019s The Wheel of TimeAs Elayne said herself she needed the support of the High Seats of ten Houses:There were over four hundred Houses in the realm but only nineteen strong enough that others would follow where they led Usually all nineteen stood behind the DaughterHeir or most of them unless she was plainly incompetent\u2026 Only ten of the nineteen were necessary to ascend the throne by law and custom Even claimants who still thought they should have the throne themselves usually fell in with the rest or at least fell silent and gave up their pursuit once another woman had ten Houses at her back Crossroads of Twilight Talk of DebtsOf these nineteen main Houses the two most recently \u2018royal\u2019 Houses are discussed first then Taravin the House currently next in line followed by the rest of the Houses in alphabetic order Nobles of minor Houses are listed at the end of the articleMantearSigil: silver anvilHouse Mantear held the throne prior to the Trakands with Mordrellen also spelt Modrellein Modrellen the most recent Queen from the House Her Aes Sedai advisor was Gitara Moroso of the Blue Ajah Lord of Chaos Tellings of the Wheel Mordrellen inherited the throne from her mother Dolera who ascended the throne in 944 NE after her mother died at the age of 78Mordrellen died in 974 NE with her two adult children Luc and Tigraine having vanished 3 and 2 years before respectivelyLucSigil: acornLuc Mantear is a

buckle on his belt as a sign he rids Tel\u2019aran\u2019rhiod of wolves haters of Shadowspawn Gitara Moroso persuaded Luc that the outcome of the Last Battle depended on his going to the Blight and he disappeared in 971 NE Lord of Chaos Tellings of the Wheel The Dark Prophecy claims he met Isam in the Mountains of Dhoom and \u201cone did live and one did die but both still are\u201d The Great Hunt Blood Calls Blood Their two souls have been combined into one body and they have been granted gifts by the Dark One including the ability to enter and leave Tel\u2019aran\u2019rhiod at will and to freely switch personalities and appearance as they do so see RJ's Blog Posts Pre Knife of Dreams article but not immunity to weapons or poison Like others who enter Tel\u2019aran\u2019rhiod frequently in the flesh they have lost a portion of their humanity and now have a barely human scent The Shadow Rising Hunter of Trollocs Both aspects of Slayer appear to be dedicated Darkfriends and Slayer is one of the Shadow\u2019s most senior henchmen Soon after the Aiel War Luc killed Janduin Rand\u2019s father in the Blight without the grieving and guiltridden Janduin offering any resistance due to Luc\u2019s resemblance to his beloved Tigraine Slayer was killed by Perrin late in the Last Battle A Memory of Light To Awaken For Slayer\u2019s deeds and scene of operations see Darkfriends articleTigraineSigil: a woman's hand gripping a thorny rosestem with a white blossomTigraine married Taringail Damodred and bore a son Galad In 972 NE Gitara Moroso convinced her:that disaster would befall her land and her people perhaps the world unless she went to dwell among the Maidens of the Spear telling no one of her going She must become a Maiden and she could not return to her own land until the Maidens had gone to Tar Valon The Shadow Rising He Who Comes With the DawnTigraine vanished from Caemlyn and went to the Aiel Waste where she was found by Maidens of the Spear She named herself Shaiel and told them why she was there Eventually she became a Maiden and was adopted into the Chumai Taardad The Shadow Rising He Who Comes with the Dawn She loved Galad and regretted leaving him but she did not love Taringail and she and Janduin the clan chief of the Taardad became lovers In 976 NE she returned to the westlands as one of the spears participating in the Aiel War She fell pregnant to Janduin but didn\u2019t leave the spears as was customary She died on Dragonmount after giving birth to Rand who resembles herPerivalPerival a good looking goldenhaired twelve year old boy Knife of Dreams A Bronze Bear is the current High Seat of House Mantear He has been welleducated and is very perceptive showing considerable insight\u2014more than most of the adult High Seats\u2014into the political and military situation in Andor His advisor is his bedridden greatuncle Willim Crossroads of Twilight Rumours who would be of Mordrellen\u2019s generation Mantear was one of the first Houses to support ElayneSUCCESSIONHouse Mantear lost the throne when Mordrellen died because Tigraine the DaughterHeir had vanished and Mantear had no other girl children only boys This caused a War of Succession lasting almost two years It was won by the 16yearold Morgase Trakand in 976 NE when she obtained the support of 13 Houses Crossroads of Twilight Talk of DebtsTrakandSigil: silver keystoneMorgaseSigil: three golden keysMorgase is a very beautiful woman with long redgold curly hair blue eyes and an attractive warm voice She looks young for her age because even though very weak in the Power see Saidar Strength Ranking article she has managed to channel a few times and thus has begun to slow in aging see Ages of Characters articleMorgase went to the Tower at age 14 not because she had aspirations to be Daughter Heir but because she wished to be Aes Sedai The Fires of Heaven Memories She was there a couple of years longer than strictly necessary for her tiny ability Lord of Chaos Prologue and left to promote her claims when the Succession started She was greatly aided by the House Bard Thom Merrilyn a skilled player in the Game of Houses Two years later she had sufficient support to gain the throne and married Tigraine\u2019s widower Taringail Damodred see The Noble Houses of Cairhien article to cement her position The Fires of Heaven Memories They had two children Gawyn and Elayne Elayne was named after Elayne Treamane Ellorien\u2019s mother Morgase was a good stepmother to Galad and he thinks of her as his mother Knife of Dreams Prologue The genealogical ties between Houses Trakand Mantear and Damodred are shown in the family tree at rightElaida became Morgase\u2019s Aes Sedai advisor because she believed that House Trakand would be the key to winning the Last Battle see Foretellings article She may have had a struggle with Thom Merrilyn over advising Morgase Evidence supporting this is that Thom says there is no love lost between themWhen Elayne was an infant Taringail became tired of being consort and plotted to become Andor\u2019s first king Thom Merrilin discovered the plot and arranged for Taringail\u2019s death in a \u2018hunting accident\u2019 Morgase and Thom become lovers for a time after Taringail\u2019s death The Shadow Rising Deceptions until in 984 or 985 NE Thom heard that his nephew Owyn had been summarily gentled by the Red Ajah and rushed off to help him without explaining to Morgase She was annoyed and when Thom returned angry at all Aes Sedai they had a blazing domestic The Fires of Heaven

sentiment Morgase herself turned against the Tower after Elayne disappeared and refused to have an Aes Sedai advisor When Rahvin arrived he built on this further Rahvin favoured Trakand\u2019s enemies Compelled Morgase to order the exile of Trakand\u2019s allies and in the case of Ellorien her flogging and alienated Morgase against aides such as Bryne He also announced Morgase\u2019s claim to the vacant throne of Cairhien In a short time Rahvin turned Andor into a chaotic state on the brink of civil war and perhaps of war with CairhienShocked by news of rebellion in the Two Rivers Morgase shook herself free of Rahvin\u2019s Compulsion and left Andor in secret In Amadicia she signed a treaty with the Whitecloaks granting them huge concessions in exchange for military aid to oust Rand

RELOADEDAfter Morgase\u2019s flight and Rand\u2019s defeat of Rahvin Elayne could not be found This created a window of opportunity for other Houses to claim the Lion Throne Rand declared that he intended Elayne to be Queen but the nobles objected to an outsider deciding the succession some were against the Trakands at all after the last year of Morgase\u2019s rule and some had ambitions for

Conscious of the need for an heir she is now pregnant with twins a boy and a girl Winter\u2019s Heart A Lily in WinterThis is Elayne\u2019s assessment of the recent state of Andoran politics:Mending the damage Rahvin had done in Andor might take her entire lifetime even if she managed to live as long as the Kinswomen Some Houses would stand aside from supporting her because of the outrages Gaebril had perpetrated in Morgase\u2019s name and others because Rand had said he intended to \u201cgive\u201d her the throne She loved the man to her toes but burn him for giving voice to that Even if it was what reined in Dyelin Winter\u2019s Heart PrologueElayne\u2019s bid for the Lion Throne was first supported by Dyelin Taravin In Crossroads of Twilight they were joined by four other High Seats: Brantlet Gilyard Catalyn Haevin Perival Mantear and Conail Northan At this stage Aemlyn Arathelle and Pelivar still wanted Dyelin to make a claim but were less enthusiastic than in Lord of Chaos Luan and Abelle were noncommittal and Dyelin thought they might be inclining to Elayne in Knife of Dreams A Bronze Bear Ellorien was totally against Trakand and was keen for Dyelin to take the throne not entirely disinterestedly see below They divided into two groups: Aemlyn Carand Pelivar Coelan and Arathelle Renshar in one and Luan Norwelyn Abelle Pendar and Ellorien Traemane in the other These six were holding back because of the presence near Caemlyn of the Borderlanders\u2019 armies They also asked Arymilla to wait until the Borderlanders turned back She replied that she wanted time to consider and then redoubled her efforts to breach Caemlyn\u2019s wallsAfter Arymilla\u2019s defeat Sylvase Caeren Lir Baryn and Karind Anshar switched sides and joined Elayne They published their support for Elayne and so did Dyelin at this time Knife of Dreams The Importance of DyelinThe six uncommitted High Seats feared the Borderlanders and parleyed with Elayne to offer a truce until they were defeated Elayne finally explained that the Borderlanders were looking for Rand and did not want to invade Andor Abelle Pendar and Luan Norwelyn then declared for Elayne making 11 Houses enough for Elayne to gain the throne Thereupon Arathelle Renshar Pelivar Coelan and Aemlyn Carand also declared their support for Elayne in the interest of unity because they supported Dyelin and she asked them to Knife of Dreams The Importance of Dyelin There are thus fourteen Houses supporting Elayne as Queen of AndorEllorien Traemane will not support Elayne and Elenia and Jarid Sarand Naean Arawn and Arymilla Marne are unable to: Sarand and Arawn published their support of Arymilla and it would destroy their Houses to recant The Andoran system is thus one of clientism not feudalism\u2014supported by the fact that the common people are free and not serfs The Minor Houses follow the bigger ones not because they owe them unbreakable allegiance for their lands but because they have committed themselves to a patronclient relationship That is why if a major House recants its declaration of support for another House the minor houses sworn to them would abandon them and they would lose all influence In a feudal system the small houses would rise and fall with the big one they are sworn to The Andoran system is thus like that of France under Louis XIV not the English landedbased systemElayne has decided she wouldn\u2019t accept Arymilla\u2019s support if she offered it Danine Candraed refused to support anyone in either Succession While she would receive less favour from the Throne by avoiding these fights her forces should be intact see belowLir and Karind expect to be shown favour by Elayne because they joined Elayne before she had the throne but she won\u2019t because they supported Arymilla first Knife of Dreams Nine Out of TenThe custom is for the Queen to pardon her rivals after the coronation and after they pay any ransoms due but Elayne was careful:Those two who had been in the Palace and more who had opposed Morgase Trakand's claim to the throne accepted her amnesty once she had it then betrayed her She would not make her mother's mistake Oh there must be amnesty wherever possible\u2014anything else was planting the seeds for a civil war\u2014but she planned to watch those who took her pardon very closely Winter\u2019s Heart Sea Folk and KinShe was

The women before her bowed down furtherThis leaves the Crown with a conundrum Elayne said You vex us with your troubling existences Perhaps some queens would have left you to prison but I find that reeks of indecision You would drain my resources and make men whisper of ways to free youThe hall fell silent save for the husky breathing of the prisonersThis Crown is not prone to indecisiveness Elayne pronounced On this day Houses Sarand Marne and Arawn are stripped of title and estate their lands forfeit to the Crown in retribution for their crimes Towers of Midnight Choosing Enemiesso Elayne boldly stripped them of their titles and property and offered their lands to Cairhienin nobles to bribe them to support her for the Cairhien throne She then offered Elenia Sarand Naean Arawn and Arymilla Marne lands in Cairhien:Lady Sarand Elayne called toward the back of the roomElenia stepped forward wearing her ragsThe Crown is not without mercy Elayne said Andor cannot forgive you for the pain and suffering you caused But other countries have no such memories Tell me if the Crown were to provide you with an opportunity for new lands would that opportunity be takenNew lands Your Majesty Elenia asked Of which lands do you speakA unification between Andor and Cairhien would offer many opportunities Elayne said Perhaps you have heard of the Crown's alliance with Ghealdan Perhaps you have heard of the newly revitalized lands in the west of realm This is a time of great opportunity If I were to find you and your husband a place to form a new seat in Cairhien would you take what is givenI    would certainly consider it Your Majesty Elenia said showing a glimmer of hopeAnd the prisoners Dyelin said Elenia and the other two Do you really intend to find them landsYes Elayne said What I've done for them is actually very kind The Crown will assume their debts then give them a fresh start in Cairhien if this all works It will be good to have Andoran nobility taking lands there though I will probably have to give them land out of my own Cairhienin holdings Towers of Midnight Choosing EnemiesIn another deal Elayne contracted the Band of the Red Hand for military services including sole operating of the dragons in exchange for giving the Band one in four dragons Towers of Midnight Talk of DragonsShe will grant the Two Rivers to the Dragon Reborn and Perrin will be his steward there:If the lands are granted to the Dragon Reborn giving him a title in Andor and making the Two Rivers his seat then it will make sense for your home to be treated differentlyThe noble Houses of Andor will accept this since the Two Rivers is where Rand came from and Andor does owe him a debt We'll have him appoint Perrin's line as his stewards Instead of capitulating to rebels

that their ties to Rand give them the right of conquest She grew thoughtful tapping the side of her cupThat seems reasonable Perrin said nodding Steward of the Two Rivers I like the sound of thatYes well Faile said I guess it's settled thenThe taxes Elayne said as if she hadn't heard You put them into a trust to be administered by Perrin and his line with the understanding that if the Dragon ever returns he can call upon them Yes That gives us a legal excuse for your exemption Of course Perrin will have authority to dip into those funds to improve the Two Rivers Roads food stores defenses Towers of Midnight A Teaching ChamberWhen Dyelin talked about wanting stability in Andor in Knife of Dreams she referred to the support from Rand and also from the Tower that Elayne can garner Other Andoran High Seats may be thinking the same thing What the nobles don\u2019t fully appreciate is that Elayne will likely live for at least 300 years If she were killed much sooner then Dyelin is next in line to the throne of Andor\u2014until the twins are born:\u201cIf Morgase and Elayne both died\u2014the Light send it not so\u2014then Morgase\u2019s nearest female relative would take the throne

spoke to Elayne about the need for stability of government and the undesirability of needless changes in ruling HousesElayne wondered at her motives in refusing to run for the throne:Was Dyelin simply

not switch sides like the others since she had published her support for House Marne and recanting would break her House:Publication meant Naean\u2019s destruction unless Elenia was fool enough to

by Linda at 4:00 PMLabels: Maps Nations15 comments:Rurouni Kenshin saidGreat work I especially like how you overlaid Andor's outline over the nations of the Free Year EraMarch 28 2009 at 10:28 PMNeth saidis the Black Tower really SE of Caemlyn and so closeI'd always pictured it a bit further a way and on the NW side of the cityMarch 29 2009 at 2:55 PMDominic saidIt's definitely not NW Northwest is where Bashere had his camp and where the Legion was based Northeast were Baiel's Aiel The BT is in the opposite direction from Bashere and the Legion Elayne in KOD looking at the City's map mentions that it is south The distance she gives is 'less than two leagues' south of the City the BT grounds are squareish and ca 4 sq miles in size 2 leagues = 8 miles This means the BT is anywhere between 5 to almost 8 miles from the south wall Elayne never includes Low Caemlyn when she uses 'The City'  she means the outer wall probably more like 6 to close to 8 miles as under that distance Elayne would more likely have said 'just over a league south' The exact location south of Caemlyn is still speculative though we'll probably get those details in AMOL and I'll update the maps accordinglyThe distance from the walls isn't great enough to force the characters to use 'south east' or 'south west' when they talk about it especially not characters like Elayne It would be different if Bashere or a Winfinder had given the location for example I placed it east of the FM road arbitrarily It could also be between the FM and Lugard Roads though at that distance or so there's a small river not mentionned in any BT chapter on that side Another reason I opted to place it in the east is that there were scenes with Elayne coming from Cullen's Crossing and she didn't mention seing the BT or getting close to the BT Also there are woods near the BT and the impression left me by the bits of descriptions in the books is that plain south of Caemlyn is rather a cultivated area with a great deal of villages south of Caemlyn is the 'heart' of Andor  the north of the capitalthe northwest in particular aren't very populated We know Rand chose a more isolated spot but didn't foresee the expansion his modest 'farm' would take nor that Taim would raise fortifications all around The BT shouldn't be quite 'hidden' anymoreIn a few days I'll post my 'commentary' for the two maps as I include them in the Forthcoming 'Atlas' section I'll discuss how it was made what is accurate and what are the sources for this accurate information and what is purely speculative or even artistic licenseMarch 29 2009 at 3:43 PMAdam Whitehead saidExcellent works on the maps I've been trying to create some decent WoT maps for the WoT Wiki and my attempts have all be unusably bad I'd be interested to see how you did yoursAnd yeah the Black Tower is almost ridiculously close to Caemlyn but I'm guessing Rand wanted it close enough for him to keep an eyeOh yeah isn't there at least one village between Carysford and Caemlyn I vaguely remember Rand and Mat on the back of the cart passing through it and never learning its name before they get to CaemlynMarch 30 2009 at 1:10 PMDominic saidThanks for the comments Adam Your Malazan or was it ASOIaF continents I've seen them long ago as I was reading those series maps aren't half bad and they were very clear  your WOT ones may not be as bad as you think I'll try to explain in some details how I worked in my 'atlas' post after the AMOL hooha has calmed down probablyAnd you're absolutely right about the village I ended up not including it IRRC because this map is a bit too precise and it was hard to tell here it was between Carysford and Caemlyn and wbecause there are villages and small roads every few miles pretty much all around the city especially in the south thoughI'm am not the greatest maniac about 'accuracy' That is I want these maps to be as accurate as I can be with some cheats and I make my research carefully and will listen to feedback but personally I wouldn't mind taking more artistic license here and there like putting a network of country roads and everything the books speak of but don't showdescribe in enough detail I stopped doing this though once I decided it'd be cool sharing the maps on the web For this map it stopped at rendering Low Caemlyn my own way based on the descriptionsthat stretches for a mile or two all around the city and there are farmer markets at each main gates That I felt was safe enough Adding country roads and villages I decided against though lookwise I'd be happy to have themI personally know what is accurate and what isn't but I'd cringe if I saw people on MB use my invented facts as the truth in their speculation It's partly why for each map I'll give the sources of factual information and spell out what I invented and what I've guessed at and what I'm fairly certain of It's a compromise between making the maps look just like I want but still remain fairly valid referencesThat unnamed village you speak of I have put on another map of Andor that isn't published yet though At some point I will post a few sketches of maps with tentative locations to get feedbackdiscussions before I make final versionsMarch 30 2009 at 4:04 PMAdam Whitehead saidSomething else that is interesting is that I note the spelling 'Modrellen' has been adopted for Tigraine's mother both here and on some of the other resource sites Did RJ formally retcon the spelling Both the world book and Lord of Chaos spell the name 'Modrellein' on multiple occasionsApril 5 2009 at 10:32 PMLinda saidI've seen it spelt both ways in the books so I don't think its an issueApril 6 2009 at 2:38 AMChris Moorhead saidI corrected that one on the WoT wiki Mordrellen seems to be the correct spelling to me though the Guide does quote Mordrellein I can't find any references to Mordrellein in the series but I can find five references to Mordrellen from four different chapters LOC CH16 COT CH11  CH14 and TFOH CH19 Since COT was published after the Guide and the Guide is not strictly canon I'd go with MordrellenJust one comment on the article itself I noticed in skimming through  Elayne was named after Ellorien's grandmother and not her motherApril 7 2009 at 11:15 PMChris Moorhead saidWill you ever release notes on the sigils I was collecting info on them a while back myself and have a couple of observationsI notice that you chose not to speculate on the backing colours where it isn't specifically mentioned I'd probably say that it is safe enough to assume that Arawn's back is blue because Naean wears house colours almost with an obsessive pride I have in my notes also that Haevin should be a blue bear on a back of green and Taravin is also on a back of green though unfortunately I did not note the reference I probably insinuated it from frequency of clothing and I think in Haevin's case a particular brooch that Catelyn was wearingEqually there are some things that I missed The colour on Elayne's back for example and the reference to entwined roses for Coelan I just have 'roses' Also the back for Sarand's golden boars which I also only have one ofWith regard to Elayne's sigil I see it as a golden fleurdelis which works nicely as a personal sigilI really like the golden antlered stag I chose just to display the head but I like the proud stance in yours : I also like how you placed Morgase's triple keys and the arrows of Carand I had the arrows shooting through the air in mine I had a lot of trouble imagining how an owl and oak worked in a sigil for Taravin I had an owl with its wings outstretched above an oak tree I think in retrospect it may work halved diagonally or in diagonal quartersGood to see the images anyway Linda told me about them when I suggested adding some to the WoTmania FAQApril 9 2009 at 3:49 PMDominic saidWe've totally left out speculation in the 'Nations' articles After discussing it with Linda we decided to only show the sigils as referencedecorations in those articles But I have all that in the article on Heraldry which will be published in installements probably the next 'series' once I'm done with the Inn signs For that one I have included the 'neutral' version the classic 'grey lines' used in that case in real heraldry for unknown fields or unknown colours of charges as well as the speculative full colour version Often I've added the banners and the seals when we add them and cons staff crowns house colours etc  that sort of thingsIn Elayne's case I have two versions of the sigils one with the realistic golden lily in bloom we know it's a real flower Rand brought her one and one with the Bourbons' gold FleurdeLys Intuitively it's how I see her sigil but OTOH I hesitate because there are instances in the books where RJ specified a charge isn't shown as natural but stylized Alliandre's sigil is one such  some sort of stylized flower  and several Seanchan symbols and quite a few others So did he meant the charges not described as stylized are natural Hard to tell so in some cases like Elayne's I did both I also did that for quite a few other 'historical sigils' which if shown as stylized are from the real world: Amadicia's for example is a Scottish Order's with the colours inverted Elayne's is interesting because of her claim on Cairhien and England's on the French Throne at some point Hoouse Trakand's sigil is shown here natural but I also have a version that is the keystone of the Free Masons a version of Luthair's banner 'natural' and another stylized  which gives us the arms of Napoleon etcI agree the formal clothes are fairly solid evidence for the missing fields and the same I've most used because it's corroborated by a few cases where we know the field of a sigil and they match the colours the character will wear in a formal setting Elayne used to dress in blue and gold before going to the Tower for instance she favours green but not exclusively now As I point out in the article which is essentially written  what is yet to be completed are the mini essay on colour symbolism in WOT which is part of the introduction and a few interpretations of sigils have to be completedtweaked in many places RJ alternated between giving the colours of the sigils and that of the formal clothes IMO he did that to give us the colours associated to the characters without becoming too repetitive especially in Andoran scenes with many High Seats present I guess the formality of the colours involved is also the explanation why we have quite a few mentions that the colours do not suit the woman or man wearing themA few other 'confirmations' rather come from the uniforms of armsmen  One of Ingtar's soldier wear his Grey Owl on a yellow tabard or cloak can't recall for exampleRJ had tons of fun with those banners and sigils quite a few are little riddles in truth maybe they all are and I could only solve a few He also amuse himself with descriptions each time Ingtar's party is on the trail in TGH the banner is soaring in the wind Each time they get stuck or lose the trail the banner is described as drooping That's the sort of things you only catch on doing data gathering in the books otherwise I guess the 'mood' of the banner is recorded subconsciously and influence perception of the scene but the fact RJ did it systematically isn't apparent Another of his 'tricks' was to add as often as possible a source of liquidwater in descriptions of locations and to qualify is as pure clean soiled tepid calm or eager tainted and often as poisonnedbitter  all metaphors for the True Source of course It's especially obvious in EOTW  Tam for instance will test water from his well fearing the Stranger came and tainted it  he drinks suspiciously hesitates and say 'it's clean' with a big smile of relief Wellssprings with water gushing from the ground is most often related to saidin for saidar RJ rather used metaphors about springriversrunning water  following the same imagery the Aes Sedai use  actually he used the combined metaphor in chapter 1 for the Winespring completing it with the mention of the Waterwheel of the miller after which the winespring spread out in a giant pattern of little springs in the waterwood and a few chapters later he has Moiraine use the same imagery almost word for word to Egwene to explain saidar and saidin driving the Wheel In later books it's still there but RJ became more subtle about it But for instance once Rand starts gathering to him male channelers he has a scene where Perrin had a great many new wells dug around EF and Faile has new irrigation canals dug crossing the fields the two working together and resulting in better reapings In the same scene she mentions she was gifted with a weaver's wheels and that from now on the TR would no longer export plain wool but woven fabrics or carpets I forget RJ may not have been the best writer in the world at least to some but he excelled at using the details of his world building to evoke the big themes of his story  and heraldry was one of his 'toolsApril 9 2009 at 11:49 PMAdam Whitehead saidNow this is interesting I doublechecked the chapters Chris mentioned in my copies of the books the references in LoC p 397 and FoH p 318 spell the name 'Modrellein' as does the Guide CoT is the only book where I can find this alternate spellingMy editions of LoC and FoH are 1995 mmpbs from Orbit my copy of the Guide is the first Orbit 1997 hardcover and my CoT is the first Orbit 2002 hardcover the one that came out in 2002 and RJ got cross about : Are we looking at a retcon here thenOoh and either the First or Second War of Andoran succession was fought c 500 NE long before Mantear or I believe Norwelwyn's time Elayne mentions a huge civil war 500 years ago in Chapter 14 of CoTApril 11 2009 at 10:12 PMChris Moorhead saidHmmm that is a puzzle From all the material you were adding from the Guide at the time I assumed that you had used it when writing the entry on Mordrellein I use a PDF file of the books and I can forward that to you if you are interested which allows you to search for any word or spelling instantly I'm not sure what version the PDF files are from so I'll check my paperbacks when I get back home They also Orbit editions but not first editions My version of the Guide is the same as yours as is my version of CoT Perhaps postPoD prints have MordrellenApril 12 2009 at 10:07 AMAdam Whitehead saidVery odd I'm assuming Tigraine's mother and the Queen in 300 NE won't have the same name as Tigraine's mother would then be 'Modrellein II' or whatever I'm wondering if this is something RJ got confused over and tried to retcon later on That would make 'Mordrellen' the right name for Tigrain'e mother and 'Modrellein' for the older queen 'Modrellein' is the spelling I have for the older Queen in THE DRAGON REBORNNot a critically important point but annoyingApril 12 2009 at 3:04 PMDominic saidI was aware that one of the wars of succession occured ca 500 NE but thanks for pointing it out nonetheless  we may have missed trivia like this just not this oneIt is entirely possible that Houses Norwelyn and House Mantear have been the only two Houses to rule Andor after the direct line from Ishara ended and before House Trakand took the throne Not altogether likely because Elayne seemed to imply once there may have been some instances where there was a succession without a war of succession yet given the stability of Andor I doubt tons of other houses have ruled it though but if the interpretation of the ambiguous mention is wrong and since there's been three wars of succession it is possible Trakand is only the fourth House to rule Andor since Ishara For a chnage of House to happen the direct female descendance of all the Queens of the House have to become exctinct or the living femalea to be so unsuitable that other Houses make a claim and gain enough support  Elayne's initial shock that the legitimate heir was contested and her distate every time the word 'succession' was mentionned in relation to the case of Trakand suggests this isn't normal whenever a female relative from the former Queens' line remains alive and has rarely happened before After Tigraine's any female offspring of Mordrellen's sisters would have had a claim and beyond that any female offspring of Mordrellen's maternal aunts etc As has been pointed out in the books House Mantear had completely run out of living female offsprings after Mordrellen's death thus the SuccessionElayne was reading books covering the timespan of the history of the realm and she mentionned books written under Mantear and Trakand so perhaps she was implying those were the only two ruling Houses after IsharaI'll confess holding like Linda zero fascination at all for the spelling of Mordrellen What's the correct spelling of the name of someone who doesn't exist anyway That most often appearing in published books that in RJ's notes even if it was entered there with a mistake leading to more variants in other published works etc We do not know who edited the 'Guide' and what access the editor had to RJ's source material beyond what he gave to T Patterson none I'd say but who knows and we do not know if given the ridiculously short time between delivery of manuscripts Orbit works from the final version of Tor's edit or if they start earlier with the same version of the manuscript delivered by RJ and not yet 100% copyedited in which case it would be all the more likely that a few corrections found out and made in the Tor editions failed to make their way to Orbit's in time We also don't know how RJ's assistants worked for instance how much they documented editorial revisions in his notes etc In any case Linda and me have spotted many small discrepancies like this in spelling between the Tor and Orbit editions Jancy becoming a Jannacy and such Unless this leads to a misindentification of the characters involved and so far we have not met any of those I'll admit to finding the topic of spelling errors fairly boring :April 13 2009 at 6:56

of the Week isitThursdayyet2017 Valspar Championship Picks Including the DriverOffTheDeck BOLD Play of the Week isitThursdayyetMarch 6 2017 by Joel Harrington Leave a CommentHamsandwiched among the Florida Swing\u2019s Honda Classic WGCMexico Championship and Arnie\u2019s Tourney at Bay Hill is this week\u2019s Valspar Championship home of the Snake Pit Um talk about a notso ringing endorsement Well guess what this tournament may get overlooked by some but I\u2019m here to tell you that this is one of the best sleeper courses  tourneys on the PGA Tour schedule and some top level talent has started to take noticeFirst the course\u2014Innisbrook Resort\u2019s Copperhead Course\u2014is one of the most difficult par 71s in a nonmajor year after year averaging roughly 1 stroke over par per round At 7340 yards it\u2019s not overly long and somewhat uniquely does have four par 5s rare for a par 71 With threadtheneedle tee shots and consistently firm fast greens it\u2019s one of the Tour\u2019s most demanding tracks Last year\u2019s tourney was the debut of the course now adding Celebration Bermudagrass on its fairways TifEagle Bermuda on its greens and also some larger tee boxes and greens to bootMy picks last week at the WGCMexico Championship were just soso as Lockzilla Sergio Garcia notched a t12th place finish and my DriverofftheDeck BOLD play of the week on Lee Westwood was looking mighty good after he was tied for the lead after day 1 and just one shot out of the lead early on Sunday but a ridiculous 4 double bogies FOUR in a 6 hole stretch on Sunday caused him to balloon to a final round 78 and a t28th place finish My BUST pick of the week Martin Kaymer finished a sleepy t23rdNow let\u2019s hop into some picks for this week:LOCKZILLA Last week: Sergio t12thHenrik Stenson\u2013 I had Henrik in OAD last week and he WD\u2019d during round 1 which means that he\u2019ll win this week only halfkidding The Swede is a top 10 machine posting six straight top 10s internationally prior to last week\u2019s debacle Add in that he has a solo 4th and a t11th place finish here in two appearances and he\u2019s definitely someone you need to pay up for this weekSEMIFLIER Last week: Grillo t52ndWebb Simpson\u2013 The 2011 Valspar runnerup has three other top 20s here despite missing the cut at the Innisbrook Copperhead course in his last two appearances Been in solid form of late reeling off 78 in made cuts including a playoff loss just a few weeks back in Phoenix A very steady pick this week with high upsideHOSELROCKET BUST Last week: Kaymer t23rdWesley Bryan\u2013 The February PGA Tour flavor of the month comes into the Valspar this week on the heels of backtoback t4th place finishes at The Honda Classic and The Genesis Open Don\u2019t just go auto plugandplay here though folks just due to a couple of high finishes as he\u2019s a firsttimer at this track and struggles with accuracy off the tee at times and is not long either Stay away from the rookie this week and thank me laterDRIVEROFFTHEDECK BOLD PLAY OF THE WEEK Last week: Westwood t28thSteve Stricker\u2013 Special shout out to the recentlyturned 50 years of age Strick Pretty sure this is the first time that I\u2019ve ever slotted anyone as my BOLD pick that is Champions Toureligible Calling it right now that this week\u2019s telecast will be mighty heavy on the 50yearold mentions Anyway Strick and his sparkling career record here plethora of top 10s including a t7th here last year come in on the heels of a t23rd place finish just a few weeks ago at Pebble Beach Look for another cozy top 25 finish with top 10 upside this weekisitThursdayyetJoel Harrington@joel4deepgolfFiled Under: PGA Tour Tagged With: Fantasy Golf golf PGA Tour PGA Tour picks Valspar

Child adoption uganda  Child adoption jacksonville fl Child adoption attorneyHomeLegalSitemapThe practice of closed adoption aka confidential or secret adoption74 which has not been the norm for most of modern history75 seals all identifying information maintaining it as secret and preventing disclosure of the adoptive parents' biological kins' and adoptees' identities Nevertheless closed adoption may allow the transmittal of nonidentifying information such as medical history and religious and ethnic background76 Today as a result of safe haven laws passed by some US states secret adoption is seeing renewed influence In socalled safehaven states infants can be left anonymously at hospitals fire departments or police stations within a few days of birth a practice criticized by some adoption

and neutral language is based upon the concept that language represents thought and may even control thought190The stigmas associated with adoption are amplified for children in foster care149 Negative perceptions result in the belief that such children are so troubled it would be impossible to adopt them and create normal families150 A 2004 report from the Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care has shown that the number of children waiting in foster care doubled since the 1980s and now remains steady at about a halfmillion a year151In sum reunions can bring a variety of issues for adoptees and parents Nevertheless most reunion results appear to be positive In the largest study to date based on the responses of 1007 adoptees and relinquishing parents 90% responded that reunion was a beneficial experience This does not however imply ongoing relationships were formed between adoptee and parent nor that this was the goal170The stigmas associated with adoption are amplified for children in foster care149 Negative perceptions result in the belief that such children are so troubled it would be impossible to adopt them and create normal families150 A 2004 report from the Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care has shown that the number of children waiting in foster care doubled since the 1980s and now remains steady at about a halfmillion a year151Foster care adoption: this is a type of domestic adoption where a child is initially placed in public care Many times the foster parents take on the adoption when the children become legally free Its importance as an avenue for adoption varies by country Of the 127500 adoptions in the US in 200083 about 51000 or 40% were through the foster care system84Beyond the foundational issues the unique questions posed for adoptive parents are varied They include how to respond to stereotypes answering questions about heritage and how best to maintain connections with biological kin when in an open adoption97 One author suggests a common question adoptive parents have is: Will we love the child even though heshe is not our biological child98 A specific concern for many parents is accommodating an adoptee in the classroom99 Familiar lessons like draw your family tree or trace your eye color back through your parents and grandparents to see where your genes come from could be hurtful to children who were adopted and do not know this biological information Numerous suggestions have been made to substitute new lessons eg focusing on family orchards100Infant adoption during Antiquity appears rare47 Abandoned children were often picked up for slavery8 and composed a significant percentage of the Empire's slave supply910 Roman legal records indicate that foundlings were occasionally taken in by families and raised as a son or daughter Although not normally adopted under Roman Law the children called alumni were reared in an arrangement similar to guardianship being considered the property of the father who abandoned them11This system of apprenticeship and informal adoption extended into the 19th century today seen as a transitional phase for adoption history Under the direction of social welfare activists orphan asylums began to promote adoptions based on sentiment rather than work children were placed out under agreements to provide care for them as family members instead of under contracts for apprenticeship21 The growth of this model is believed to have contributed to the enactment of the first modern adoption law in 1851 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts unique in that it codified the ideal of the best interests of the child2223 Despite its intent though in practice the system operated much the same as earlier incarnations The experience of the Boston Female Asylum BFA is a good example which had up to 30% of its charges adopted out by 188824 Officials of the BFA noted that although the asylum promoted otherwise adoptive parents did not distinguish between indenture and adoption We believe the asylum officials said that often when children of a younger age are taken to be adopted the adoption is only another name for service25Open adoption allows identifying information to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and perhaps interaction between kin and the adopted person71 Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive parents who have sole custody over the child In some jurisdictions the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation exchange of information or other interaction regarding the child72 As of February 2009 24 US states allowed legally enforceable open adoption contract agreements to be included in the adoption finalization73Adopting older children presents other parenting issues101 Some children from foster care have histories of maltreatment such as physical and psychological neglect physical abuse and sexual abuse and are at risk of developing psychiatric problems102103 Such children are at risk of developing a disorganized attachment104105106 Studies by Cicchetti et al 1990 1995 found that 80% of abused and maltreated infants in their sample exhibited disorganized attachment styles107108 Disorganized attachment is associated with a number of developmental problems including dissociative symptoms109 as well as depressive anxiety and actingout symptoms110111 Attachment is an active process it can be secure or insecure maladaptive or productive112 In the UK some adoptions fail because the adoptive parents do not get sufficient support to deal with difficult traumatized children This is a false economy as local authority care for these children is extremely expensive113Family plays a vital role in identity formation This is not only true in childhood but also in adolescence Identity gendersexualethnicreligiousfamily is still forming during adolescence and family holds a vital key to this The research seems to be unanimous a stable secure loving honest and supportive family in which all members feel safe to explore their identity is necessary for the formation of a sound identity Transracial and International adoptions are some factors that play a significant role in the identity construction of adoptees Many tensions arise from relationships built between the adoptees and their family These include being different from the parents developing a positive racial identity and dealing with racialethnic discrimination130 It has been found that multicultural and transnational youth tend to identify with their parents origin of culture and ethnicity rather than their residing location yet it is sometimes hard to balance an identity between the two because school environments tend to lack diversity and acknowledgment regarding such topics131 These tensions also tend to create questions for the adoptee as well as the family to contemplate Some common questions include what will happen if the family is more na\u00efve to the ways of socially constructed life Will tensions arise if this is the case What if the very people that are supposed to be modeling a sound identity are in fact riddled with insecurities Ginni Snodgrass answers these questions in the following way The secrecy in an adoptive family and the denial that the adoptive family is different builds dysfunction into it \u00a0social workers and insecure adoptive parents have structured a family relationship that is based on dishonesty evasions and exploitation To believe that good relationships will develop on such a foundation is psychologically unsound Lawrence Secrecy erects barriers to forming a healthy identity132The research literature states adoptees give four reasons for desiring reunion: 1 they wish for a more complete genealogy 2 they are curious about events leading to their conception birth and relinquishment 3 they hope to pass on information to their children and 4 they have a need for a detailed biological background including medical information It is speculated by adoption researchers however that the reasons given are incomplete: although such information could be communicated by a thirdparty interviews with adoptees who sought reunion found they expressed a need to actually meet biological relations167Other studies provide evidence that adoptive relationships can form along other lines A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents and concludes adoptive parents enrich their children's lives to compensate for the lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption94 Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children for example by providing further education and financial support Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction the study speculated that adoptive parents might invest more in adoptees not because they favor them but because they are more likely than genetic children to need the help95Foster care adoption: this is a type of domestic adoption where a child is initially placed in public care Many times the foster parents take on the adoption when the children become legally free Its importance as an avenue for adoption varies by country Of the 127500 adoptions in the US in 200083 about 51000 or 40% were through the foster care system84Who are the children who wait The children who wait are the survivors of abuse and neglect They are school aged children siblings children of color and children with disabilities Each of them waits for adoption and there are more than 114000 of them across the country These children live in a series of foster and group homes for an average of three years There they wait while they hope for the stability of an adoptive familyReading time: 6 mins 34 sec Dog rehoming in the first place is not abandonment as a matter of fact it\u2019s humane mature and responsible Secondly while there are

VisitsBooksReviewsStoriesFamily  Friends SnapshotsContact AmyHomeTeachers and Kids GuideThe Castle in the Mist Teachers and Kids GuideThe Castle in the Mist Teachers and Kids GuideThe Castle in the Mistby Amy EphronGame and Reader\u2019s Guide for Teachers  Kidsthings to think about and answerIn the beginning of \u201cThe Castle in the Mist\u201d Tess and Max have a small fight over a Monopoly gameInstead of having a real fight Tess goes outside to take a walk as they\u2019ve promised their Mom they wouldn\u2019t fight around Aunt Evie What tricks do you use to stop a fight or not have a fightTess then walks up the hill above her Aunt\u2019s house in Hampshire England She discovers actually runs into an invisible wall that has a visible but locked oldfashioned wooden gate She then finds a skeleton key in the dirt and now she has a dilemma  is it right or wrong to use the key If you find the key to somebody\u2019s house is it okay to use it Absolutely not But this is the key to a gate in an invisible wall\u2026 Before she can even decide the key has a mind of its own\u2026 Do you think she\u2019s taken a step back in time or just a step into a magical placeHave you ever had a dilemma If you think that somebody did something wrong or maybe told you a lie do you tell Does it depend on the circumstance Do you talk to your friend An adult Permission given to use madeup names for this answerTess often looks things upWhen William the boy in the castle tells her to beware of the hawthorn trees she takes him quite seriously and at her first opportunity she looks up Hawthorn Trees in a book her Aunt has about plants and trees and discovers that the berries of hawthorn trees are believed to heal broken hearts Do you look things up How do you do research if you don\u2019t understand something What are your best google tips or how you use the library Do you ever \u201cask an expert\u201dWhen things get tough Tess and Max do a pinkie swear A pinkie swear means they have each other\u2019s backs How do you let your friends parents teachers or siblings know you have their back\u201cHealing hearts\u201d is also a theme of the book and a metaphor for the plot of the book as Tess and Max\u2019s adventures often end in Tess being able to \u201cundo\u201d a longago tragedy or heal a heartache Is there a metaphor you like Here\u2019s an example of a simple metaphor I use in \u201cThe Other Side of the Wall\u201d the third book: \u201cThe snow was falling like petals all around them\u201d Snow doesn\u2019t fall in petals but the use of the word petals is like flower petals dropping and calls up an image in other words a metaphor for the way the snow falls Here\u2019s an easy example: The playground was a zoo Do you have a metaphor you like Can you make one upWhen Tess runs into an obstacle she sometimes remembers things or advice that one of her parents has told her For example: If you get lost get back to where you started from if you can Have your parents or teacher or another grownup ever given you advice about what to do if you run into trouble or have a problem you can\u2019t easily solve This can be advice about staying calm or cheering other people up ways in which you can be a leader and help others along the wayWhen Tess gets frustrated she sometimes talks herself down Sometimes she also gives herself a pep talk if she\u2019s facing a hard almost impossible task She has a conversation in her own head so that she can stay calm or rise up and help under difficult circumstances Do you have any tricks you use when you get frustrated or need to accomplish something difficultMax and Tess are very different Max is much more analytical and scientific than Tess Tess is a bit of a super hero even though she doesn\u2019t always know it Tess operates often on instinct and emotion at first If you have a sibling are you very different from each other This can even be as simple as what you eat for breakfast or the kind of clothes you wear or the music you listen to It also can be whether one of you is shy not at all shy funny plays an instrument loves sports or reads comic books If you don\u2019t have a sibling which category do you think you fit into analytical or impulsive or somewhere inbetween Do you have someone you rely on who is the oppositeA lot of magical things happen in \u201cThe Castle in the Mist\u201d \u2014 although Tess isn\u2019t always sure if it happened or if she imagined it\u2026 Did she imagine dancing with the Pleiades or did it happen What do you think Have you ever had anything happen to you that you think is magical or that you can\u2019t explain\u201cThe Castle in the Mist\u201d is considered part fantasypart reality On purpose there are no allout battles guns or explosions in the series But there are dangers \u2014 when they go to the other side of the hawthorn trees and all they can see is the planets in our solar system no stars no expansive sky or view of the galaxy just dark nothingness ahead And the rocks start to turn into morph into creatures called morphons They resemble madeup mythical creatures a deer with the trunk of an elephant a giraffe\u2019s neck on the shell of a snail which reach out and try to grab them and prevent Tess Max  William and the magical horse named Midnight from escaping and riding back through the hawthorn hedge Meanwhile back on the other side of the wall the castle starts to disappear It\u2019s almost as if there is a time clock and if they don\u2019t get back in time the castle might not be there If you were writing a fantasy book what would your fantasy world look like Would there be creatures in it Would there be music Would there be stars in the sky Would there be a sky Would there be danger Would creatures communicate with each other What would they eat Would there be plants and flowers What would they look like Would everyone get alongIf you had one wish what would it be Don\u2019t tell This is your silent question I repeat do not tell And the wish cannot be that you get all the wishes in the world Only one wish For now anywayBelieveinmagicAmy EphronCopyright \u00a9 Amy EphronPermission to use grantedNextRecent NewsThe Pandemic

2011St Cyril\u2019s Scriptural Christology1:04 AM  Posted by Jnorm   Edit PostA Paper by David BThe Link:http:ohtasteandseeblogspotcom201005scripturalchristologyofstcyrilofhtmlQuote:The treatment of communicatio idiomatum is nowhere more overt in St Cyril\u2019s writing than when he speaks about the Eucharist for he makes clear that an exchange of properties takes place between natures based on their common point of union namely that they are both proper to the one divine Son and Word of God Thus we can see that statements like \u201cthe radiance of the divine and ineffable glory of God the Father shines \u201cin the face of Jesus Christ\u201d36 can be made without fear for \u201c\u201cthe Word who is God can introduce the lifegiving power and energy of his own self into his very own flesh\u201d37 though without thinking \u201cthat the divine nature of the Word had changed into something which formerly it was not\u2026or that the flesh was changed by some kind of transformation into the nature of the Word himself\u201d38 The bread which is his flesh then is \u201cliving bread\u201d the flesh of life broken on the cross and no mere man\u2019s flesh unable to communicate life as can the \u201choly and lifegiving\u201d flesh of the Word \u201cfull of divine energy\u201d39 Thus as Keating concludes \u201cCyril\u2019s theology of the Eucharist appears to be quite straightforward: by eating of the consecrated bread we in fact partake of the flesh of Christ and so receive into ourselves the life that is in Christ through the medium of his very flesh flesh which has become lifegiving by virtue of the ineffable union of the Word to this flesh\u201d40 It is evident then that the One who offers this flesh on the cross must be the divine Son and Word of God Himself a mere taking of a man alongside the Word would not allow for a communication of the life of God through the sacrificed vivified and energized flesh given to us in the EucharistTo read the

RSSSearch1When I die where will i goI have been confronted of this in my mind for awhile now and its almost frightening me When i get cremated there will be no existence of me will i be in a permanent dream state hopefully lucid dreams but then the fact remains that my brain is now ash My whole body will be So i feel like if i now am \u201cback being unborn\u201d i will be in an unescapeable void of darkness in which i have no notice or thought of Help me understand my friends PleasePosted: April 21st 2014logicelYou have answered your own question quite neatly I might add:  i feel like if i now am \u201cback being unborn\u201d i will be in an unescapeable void of darkness in which i have no notice or thought ofThe reason it is hard to imagine what it means to be unborn or dead is because of the pesky consequences of having a conscious self a self incongruously sandwiched inbetween the before and after of our lives As far as we know we are the only species to have this kind of mind a mind that insists hey we have a self how could it at one time not be and then be and then once again not beAll the evidence points that the human brain gives forth the human mind As this very mind can cause anxiety when perusing its own mortality this same mind can also understand fully that it itself is temporaryMindfulness allows the embracing and accepting of what may seem a paradox a perspective that is also encouraged by society that humans are so special because of this very consciousness Yet if a bat or an ant or a lion could talk I think we would realize that humans are just another 'special\u2019 species and like all of them we are mortal We just have the hubris to think otherwiseThis hubris often gets in the way of being at peace with reality while being alive Religion though it bandages this festering wound of nonacceptance fails Gracefully acknowledging your temporary nature which is shared by every single other living thing is the solution In addition because of genetic duplication others\u2019 memories of us and the elemental material of our former selves bits of us do remainPosted: April 25th 2014See all questions answered by logicelIs your atheism a

pay for the damage they caused to his reputation and career This situation could potentially end the career of a cyclist who I have respected for many years It makes me glad that he's not taking this thing lying down Although it will be difficult I hope some tighter controls on the production of these supplements could be implemented as a result It is a pretty sobering thought that as professional and clean as some riders are they face the possibility of being sacked because they bought supplements that contain things not represented on the label Even to someone fully knowledgeable of the UCI's banned substance list they still have no control over this kind of situation happening to them I really respect how Mr Moninger has come out and stated his case and I hope he prevailsJohn KunertMadison WIThursday November 21 2002Respond to this letterScott Moninger 2Your article of November 21 on Scott Moninger suggests that the principle of Buyer Beware prevents action against a manufacturer or seller With respect that may not be correct at law and victims of contaminated products should consult their legal adviser in the country of purchaseThe best athletic advice I got as a junior racer was Go to Law SchoolTim BuckleyWednesday November 20 2002Respond to this letterClimbers vs Sprinters 1Regarding Mr Johnson's statement that climbing is harder than sprinting I beg to differ Yes climbing is hard and a rider's genetic disposition plays a significant role in the outcome just as a sprinter's does It is hard for a sprinter to climb and a climber to sprint You're comparing apples to orangesOften the pace of the peloton up to the point where the actual sprint begins leadout is ridden at an intensity equal or greater to that of those 3040 minute climbs The difference is that in the last 200 meters the afterburners fire up one more notch and blow out the wannabe's with one massive burst of raw power Add to that explosion an ability shown by the best of the business to maintain a clear head and think on the fly while cruising along elbow to elbow at speeds in excess of 40 mphConsider the pain and mental discipline that riders pursuing the green jersey must undertake in order to contest multiple efforts in each stageChris BrandtPortland ORWednesday November 20 2002Respond to this letterClimbers vs Sprinters 2I know the debate of which is tougher or who is better between climbers and sprinters is one of the neverending questions in cycling but I felt I needed to defend sprinters against Sammy Johnson's letter He mentions that A sprint is typically a 10 second or less all out effort Lest we forget that sprinters don't just dog it to the last 200m of a 180 mile race and then drop the hammer A pure sprinter such as Cipo may spend the last half hour or so of a relatively flat race moving up position and keeping his teammates at the right pace to catch escapees prevent new breakaways and yet not burnout his team Sprinters are constantly bumping and riding hard very near the front to maintain their position up until the last 200m or 10 seconds of the raceit's just that sprinters are never seen at the very front in the wind before the last 200 meters I'm not sure how experienced Sammy is in racing himself but I can tell you from experience it takes a lot of strength just to get yourself into position to sprint let alone whip it out in the last straightaway Don't be fooled by Cipo he really makes it look much easier than it ever isStuart PressLos Angeles CAThursday November 21 2002Respond to this letterClimbers vs Sprinters 3To say that sprinting is only 10 seconds of work is ridiculous Have you ever watched a Tour video or daily coverage The dash for the line begins about 10km from the finish sometimes more During that time every team with a sprinter tries to get to the front to control things There is a lot of jockeying for positionusually at 5560kph When was the last time you rode someone's wheel at 60kph for twenty minutesJust because a sprinter sits in someone's draft doesn't mean he does nothing He still has to be alert for splits crashes late flyers position roundabouts etc If everyone wants to be on the wheel of the favorite it is no easy task to get there and stay there If you watch some of the videos you will see how much one small bobble can cost you If someone goes down or touches wheels guys will lose 20 places in a heartbeat with no way to get back if it is the last 3km To maintain position takes lots of skill strength and nerve even if you are just draftingHere's a good question for you If it is so easy to give somebody an armchair ride to the finish why do so few teams actually do it well Just because you don't get the focused attention on a handful of riders on a difficult climb doesn't mean a field sprint is a cakewalk Johann Museeuw probably the toughest guy out there said in Cyclesport recently that though he began as a bunch sprinter he became fearful of big sprints after a few crashes Same for Jalabert What does that tell youSteve FDenver COThursday November 21 2002Respond to this letterAtrial fibrillationBobby Julich did not have a ventricular arrhythmia Rather he had a reentrant SVT http:wwwbobbyjulichcomjulichheartaspAtrial fibrillation SVT RSVT and accessory pathway tachycardias are all distinctly different forms of tachycardia that originate in the upper chambers of the heart the atria They are all distinctly different because there are differences in: 1 the etiology of the condition 2 the population at risk 3 the treatment of the conditionThis last point is the most complex one and one which is quite convoluted in the letters posted thus far To make a long story short all of the conditions can be potentially treated with radiofrequency ablation microwaving the abnormal tissue andor medications The science is young in this field and the decisions concerning treatment modality are more often on a patient by patient basisFactors that may favor the cure of radiofrequency ablation include the chronicity of the arrhythmia the age and condition of the patient and the particular form of the arrhythmia thus some are very easily treated in this manner More patient information can be found on the website for the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology http:wwwnaspeorgProspero B Gogo Jr MDBurlington VermontThursday November 21 2002Respond to this letterEPO 1In response to the very interesting article on EPO from comments I read coming from pro cyclists it seems like there is a lot of doping going on The genetic doping angle is something that was mentioned that I have never thought aboutAnthony Tan's article raises a interesting question What if someone genetically manipulated their unborn child to have the characteristics of a great cyclist Will people in the future be asking Lance LeMond and Eddy for a DNA sample In the age where you can artificially enhance eye color hair color or eliminate the precursors for cancers or certain diseases would manipulating DNA to make the perfect cyclist be considered cheating Would manipulating the DNA to make someone naturally produce high levels of haematocrit or a disposition for huge VO2 max numbers be cheating What if they could manipulate DNA on currently racing cyclistsI guess it is GATTACA the movie meets reality pretty soonJames DohPasadena CAWednesday November 27 2002Respond to this letterEPO 2How serious do you think the issue of EPO still is within pro cycling I think it's very hard to say The single most effective deterrent appears to be the UCI's 50% haematocrit limit although the number of prominent riders testing at 499 has been noticeable I wonder if it wouldn't be fairer and perhaps more pragmatic to reserve the EPO test for riders already found exceeding the UCI limit or their own if they have a doctor's exemption ie legalise controlled cheatingThe UCI for all of its gallant endeavor will I fear continue to fight a losing battle against doping Its clear from the evidence of cycling that the science and the method of evasion deployed by the sporting cheats is invariably one step ahead of the testersAlastair KnowlesEdinburgh ScotlandThursday November 28 2002Respond to this letterEPO 3Regarding general drug use in sport: if ALL athletes were made to keep an 'open book'  available for all to see  with regards to ALL they ingest from regular food stuffs over the counter supplements to doctor prescribed products wouldn't it be true to say that TRUE success in sport could only be attributed to one's physical prowess one's awareness one's training environment one's commitment to training and one's tactical knowledgeIn addition to present testing methods if samples  blood urine hair etc of all winning athletes were stored for subsequent testing for comparison with the athletes' 'open book' might that have a significant cleansing effect regarding the way all sports are both played and perceivedFinally I hear of cyclist's shunned by the peloton for 'flicking' other riders and have heard the phrase 'no longer allowed to win a stage by the peloton' used in relation to some  unnamed  individuals Yet convicted drug cheats come back after their suspensions and win stages  doesn't this seem to indicate that drug use is still widely accepted by the powers who exist within the bunchLeslie DayUKThursday November 28 2002Respond to this letterEPO 4I think as long as there is the amount of money that is in any professional sport the temptation to cheat will be present However complicated the tests are to detect it the temptation will be there I do think that the more information about how certain drugs that even doctors call as dangerous as orange juice can have detrimental effects to the rider's health even under close supervision the less they will be used The interesting thing to see in the future will be what is considered doping and who is considered liable for doing problems such as in Scott Moninger's case I think a race series like the World Cup which last all year really put a strain on riders' health This seems to put a premium on staying fit all year which seems to increase the temptationBeing from the United States and a nutritionist I think that the general lack of education about the dangers of supplement use because of the lack of regulations at least here is a cause for concern for more of the general public that people who could even afford to buy EPO I know that Collegiate athletes are constantly told to read the label on any cold medicine etc to avoid a positive drug test I get my USA cycling book like everyone else does who holds a racing license in the US and can look at what is illegal The problem is that up to 25% of the time as the British study showed those ingredients aren't listed on supplement labelsI see the benefits of EPO for people who need it to avoid constant blood transfusions and the untold risks associated with that procedure In most cases with any medicine there are risks as well as benefits and as long a professional athletes want to try and skip some level of work to strive for the top level I believe some drug use will be present in athleticsBrad ShufordWednesday November 27 2002Respond to this letter'Cross in the USA 1The state of 'cross seems to be on the rise I've been racing

region Midwest cyclocross is gaining in popularity in leaps and bounds In the last four seasons we have seen the number of cross bikes at cross races increase as well as the number of racers Not only are more people racing but the Midwest cycling community as a whole is supporting cross racesI live just outside Louisville Kentucky in Southern Indiana On any given weekend I can find a race either in Indianapolis Cincinnati Louisville Lexington or further south in Tennessee From my location these are all within two hours driving distance with the exception of Tennessee Each of these cities has a cross series of races established each promoting 4 to 5 racesWe have national caliber talent racing as well Phil Noble winner of the B's race at last year's Super Cup Chicago can be found at many of the races Lindsay Wilson College has a excellent cross team They routinely put someone in the top three each weekend I'd like to think cyclocross is longer an east coast or west coast thing There's a strong tradition of cyclocross building here in the Midwest Check us out at wwwkentuckycyclocrosscomTodd W Wieringa Rapid Transit Racing TeamLouisville KY 40206Monday November 25 2002Respond to this letter'Cross in the USA 3My opinion of cross racing in the US overall is positive but there is room for improvement I live in New Hampshire and there are numerous regionalUCI races within 25 hrs of driving from September through December Adam Myerson regional promoters and all others involved have done a super job making the number of races multiplyEveryone I ride with participates in or has participated in cyclocross The only complaint I hear about the state of cross is that it costs too much cash to race and I agreeIf you are just a pack filler in the Elite Men's you pay $2030 to race plus a $70 international license fee if you do the UCI races to compete in a 60 minute race My wife does the women's A's and is surprised that it costs her $1525 to race for 45 minutes She comes from a collegiateelite level running background and rarely paid more than $15 dollars to race At the running races she said There was almost always cookies bagels and hot coffee for participants In her opinion this made it more fun and inviting for recreational participants Some promoters do this and I congratulate them It makes for a more comfortable venueI am a college student and part time wage earner My wife is a teacher We don't have a lot of cash to invest in racing especially for races which last 4560 minutes I have no problem with road racing entry fees because the races are normally longer and follow what I recommend in the next paragraphKeeping entry fees between $1015 bucks equivalent to what a lot of people make for an hour of work could possibly make participation more appealing to those who just want to come out and have a good time racing I think the hourly rate of racing should reflect what the wage earning masses make per hour Especially if the goal of the promotersport as a whole is to attract younger 25 and under and typically less financially stable participantsAn example of this occurred with the New Hampshire State Time Trial this year run by the New Hampshire Cycling Club The entry fee was $1518 bucks All volunteers received tshirts all involved including friendsrelatives received fooddrinks and we got loads of positive feedback from participants and volunteers saying how much they enjoyed the friendly social atmosphere created by the promoters thoughtfulnessinclusion of them Having a good prize list is good but not if it means charging so much money that the masses stay home and ride on their ownThis is just meant as constructive criticism I am not a promoter and I do not know where the money goes I am expressing my views

find it funny that when people are searching for fame they love the media but as soon as they get it they seem to hate them Laurent Fignon is a good example He barely talked to the media during his hey day but now he's the one who appears to be tracking them down Loud mouth or no loud mouth Robbie is still a great rider We all have our weaknesses Perhaps though Robbie and the other cyclists who get caught out on the heat of the moment can learn from the Mighty Indurain who while very friendly and cooperative with the media was always very thoughtful controlled and careful when speakingAnyway

2002Respond to this letterThe media in cycling 2Rupert Guinness wants me to believe the criticism of the media is unfair I don't buy it Sometimes making money seems to be more important objective This might be editors rather than a journalists but I only get to see what's in print or in this case on the webIn my original letter I tried to make the point that we hear many times from many different outlets the fist in mouth comment but almost nothing a few days later when McEwen backed off If this is about reporting what is said why wasn't equal coverage given to both sets of quotes The fist quote was beat to death Very popular quote and I'm sure it gets people to read It certainly got my attention I'm not faulting the reporting so much as the emphasis I don't believe this is unfair criticism It's to me a valid pointI enjoy Cyclingnews just because there is so much content And I enjoy the Aussie point of view Thank God for the web It actually lets me choose the coverage I preferMike GatesColorado Springs COFriday November 22 2002Respond to this letterThe media in cycling 3I completely agree with Rupert on the integral role the media plays in cycling and all sports for that matter Sponsors are involved in cycling with the objective of gaining a commercial return for their investment and it is the media coverage that provides that return As Rupert pointed out no media coverage would result in no sponsors no teams and no bike races It is in the riders interest to assist the media as the more media coverage the sport receives the more sponsors will be prepared to put towards the sport which will increase the earning capacity of cyclists team management race promoters etc It's no coincidence that the athletes from the sports with the highest level of media coverage receive the highest wagesMatthew KeenanMelbourne AustraliaMonday November 25 2002Respond to this letterThe media in cycling 4In general it is the media's role to report that which is newsworthy That is to say that which is of interest to the fans supporters and participants of cycling I have to laugh at the level of speculation which is employed in reporting the soap opera that cycling can sometimes be Rumors and innuendo fly like a bunch sprint and we the public never really know the truth until the final facts cross the line Who said what conspiracy theories secret alliances and backroom negotiations make for colorful reporting and I for one delight in it As the riders are always telling us We are not machines And as their inevitable humanity emerges in the form of scandal courage frailty and fortitude the media brings us the human side of cycling As an American I am thankful to be living in a time when I can not only watch the three grand tours and a handful of spring classics on TV but can stay updated continually through Websites like Cyclingnews Thank you Media for bringing us the good the bad the unsubstantiated You keep the sport alive and

more classics the team of USPS is a very good team but they lack riders for the classics You can't build a team for the classics with just one or two riders I don't mean any disrespect for the other cyclist in the team they're good otherwise they wouldn't be riding for a top team but they mostly work in the tours for Armstrong or Heras Maybe USPS should let TB go because an unhappy cyclist will

Belgian pros to pull him aside and develop his career slowly Isn't his father an expro I think I am correct in guessing that his father has great influence on TB's career path Boonen just wants to make it big with a Belgian team that specializes in Classics period He may be with the awesome USPS where he may learn a LOT BUT USPS specializes on the Tour de France In my opinion Boonen really is

on this subject quite nicely It is edited for relevanceOftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your worldBut I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of youSo the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you alsoAnd as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole treeSo the wrongdoer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you allAnd when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him a caution against the stumbling stoneAy and he falls for those ahead of him who though faster and surer of foot yet removed not the stumbling stoneAnd this also though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wickedAnd the whitehanded is not clean in the doings of the felonYea the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injuredAnd still more often the condemned is the burdenbearer for the guiltless and unblamedYou cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wickedFor they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven togetherAnd when the black thread breaks the weaver shall look into the whole cloth and he shall examine the loom alsoAnd let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offendedAnd if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree let him see to its rootsAnd how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeedsIs not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serveYet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guiltyUnbidden shall it call in the night that men may wake and gaze upon themselvesAnd you who would understand justice how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of lightAnd that the cornerstone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundationRegis ChapmanUSAThursday November 21 2002Respond to this letterRecent letters pagesNovember 21

StateA wonderful Mahamudra text taught by a great teacherKHENCHEN THRANGU RINPOCHE WILL TEACH ON:Teaching subject: Clarifying the Natural State by Dakpo Tashi NamgyalSee http:wwwrinpochecomboudha19htmLabels: Mahamudra Thrangu Rinpoche 6 ResponsesAnonymous Says:Nov 8 2018 11:19:00 AMWat happens to all the sheathsbodies im using advaita terminologywhich makes much sense despite you repeatedly denying 'em  when one realizes ones true natureWell u can just ignore dis post if feel it doesnt bring any benefits answering it Soh Says:Nov 8 2018 1:48:00 PMThe Koshas are taught so that the person doing self inquiry will be able to recognise and dissociate from all those sheaths as 'Not Me' and finally attain realization of the True Self which is satchitananda This is to get to the Thusness Stage 1 the I AMness realizationOnce you get to Stage 4 it will be a different understanding Phenomena is no longer dissociated but the taste of I AMness is present throughout It will become like what David Carse wrote:After the jungle there is an intensely odd and very beautiful quality to the experience of life In one sense I can only describe everything all experience as having a certain emptiness This is the sense in which everything used to matter to be vital and important and is now seen as unreal empty not important an illusion Once it is seen that the beyondbrilliance of Sat Chit Ananda is all that is the dream continues as a kind of shadow Yet at the same moment that all of what appears in the dream is experienced as empty it is also seen as more deeply beautiful and perfect than ever imagined precisely because it is not other than Sat Chit Ananda than all that is Everything that does not matter that is empty illusion is at the same time itself the beyondbrilliance the perfect beauty Somehow there is a balance these two apparently opposite aspects do not cancel each other out but complement each other This makes no 'sense' yet it is how it isThere is one tradition within Advaita which says that maya the manifestation of the physical universe is overlaid or superimposed on Sat Chit Ananda I'm no scholar of these things and can only attempt to describe what is seen here and the Understanding here is that there is no question of one thing superimposed on another Maya the manifestation the physical universe is precisely Sat Chit Ananda is not other than it does not exist on its own as something separate to be overlaid on top of something else This is the whole point There is no maya The only reason it appears to have its own reality and is commonly taken to be real in itself is because of a misperceiving a mistaken perception which sees the appearance and not What Is This is the meaning of Huang Po's comment that no distinction should be made between the Absolute and the sentient world No distinction There is only One There is not ever in any sense two All perception of distinction and separation all perception of duality and all perception of what is known as physical reality is mindcreated illusion When a teacher points at the physical world and says All this is maya what is being said is that what you are seeing is illusion what all this is is All That Is pure Being Consciousness Bliss Outpouring it is your perception of it as a physical world that is maya illusionAnonymous Says:Nov 8 2018 4:25:00 PMIf one suffers unnesessarily more dan ones bad karmaeg one may be destined to get cancer but mistreatment by doctors cause more suffering or road accident due to reckless driving of others etcdoes ending life prematurely betterby ending unnessasarily sufferingSoh Says:Nov 8 2018 5:16:00 PMUnless one has become liberated one should never end life prematurely but strive to attain liberation with every second remaining in one's life by practicing deligentlyBuddha: When someone lays down this body and takes up another body I call them \u2018blameworthy\u2019Anonymous Says:Nov 8 2018 6:29:00 PMIt depends on wat kind of body taken in d afterlife  the fact is dat the astral body lacking dense physicalitybodybrainone can hv better perspectiveConsciousness trapped by limitations of dis brain simply cannot hv higher knowledgepast lives recollectionfor egwithout remembrance of past lives one simply groved in de darkchasing ephemereal things of dis worldI believe those astral beings can hv better chance of seeing their past existence and many other knowledges Soh Says:Jan 3 2019 11:52:00 PMYou mentioned having a body means one cannot recollect past lives and have higher knowledgeThis is not true Thusness and one of his 'students' Sim Pern Chong has recollected plenty of their past lives in meditation and jhana They have attained transcendental wisdomAnd so have countless practitioners of the past as documented in the suttasOne the other hand countless sages have warned that if you die without realizing your true nature you will just end up being reborn uncontrollably

layoutenablelayout=LAYOUTConfigure the source code and build scripts to assume an installation tree based on the layout LAYOUT This allows you to separately specify the locations for each type of file within the Apache HTTP Server installation The configlayout file contains several example configurations and you can also create your own custom configuration following the examples The different layouts in this file are grouped into Layout FOOLayout sections and referred to by name as in FOO The default layout is ApacheFine tuning of the installation directoriesFor better control of the installation directories use the options below Please note that the directory defaults are set by autoconf and are overwritten by the corresponding layout settingbindir=DIRInstall user executables in

BUILDtarget=TARGETConfigure for building compilers for the system type TARGET It defaults to HOST This option is offered by autoconf and not necessary for the Apache HTTP ServerOptional FeaturesThese options are used to fine tune the features your HTTP server will haveGeneral syntaxGenerally you can use the following syntax to enable or disable a feature:disableFEATUREDo not include FEATURE This is the same as enableFEATURE=noenableFEATURE=ARGInclude FEATURE The default value for ARG is yesenableMODULE=sharedThe corresponding module will be build as DSO module By default enabled modules are linked dynamicallyenableMODULE=staticThe corresponding module will be linked staticallyNoteconfigure will not complain about enablefoo even if foo doesn't exist so you need to type carefullyChoosing modules to compileMost modules are compiled by default and have to be disabled explicitly or by using the keyword few see enablemodules enablemodsshared and enablemodsstatic below for further explanation or enablemodules=none to be removed as a groupOther modules are not compiled by default and have to be enabled explicitly or by using the keywords all or reallyall to be availableTo find out which modules are compiled by default run configure h or configure help and look under Optional Features Suppose you are interested in modexample1 and modexample2 and you see this:Optional Features:    disableexample1     example module 1  enableexample2      example module 2  Then modexample1 is enabled by default and you would use disableexample1 to not compile it modexample2 is disabled by default and you would use enableexample2 to compile itMultiProcessing ModulesMultiProcessing Modules or MPMs implement the basic behavior of the server A single MPM must be active in order for the server to function The list of available MPMs appears on the module index pageMPMs can be built as DSOs for dynamic loading or statically linked with the server and are enabled using the following options:withmpm=MPMChoose the default MPM for your server If MPMs are built as DSO modules see enablempmsshared this directive selects the MPM which will be loaded in the default configuration file Otherwise this directive selects the only available MPM which will be statically linked into the serverIf this option is omitted the default MPM for your operating system will be usedenablempmsshared=MPMLISTEnable a list of MPMs as dynamic shared modules One of these modules must be loaded dynamically using the LoadModule directiveMPMLIST is a spaceseparated list of MPM names enclosed by quotation marks For example:enablempmsshared='prefork worker'Additionally you can use the special keyword all which will select all MPMs which support dynamic loading on the current platform and build them as DSO modules For example:enablempmsshared=allThirdparty modulesTo add additional thirdparty modules use the following options:withmodule=moduletype:modulefile moduletype:modulefileAdd one or more thirdparty modules to the list of statically linked modules The module source file modulefile will be searched in the modulesmoduletype subdirectory of your Apache HTTP server source tree If it is not found there configure is considering modulefile to be an absolute file path and tries to copy the source file into the moduletype subdirectory If the subdirectory doesn't exist it will be created and populated with a standard MakefileinThis option is useful to add small external modules consisting of one source file For more complex modules you should read the vendor's documentationNoteIf you want to build a DSO module instead of a statically linked use apxsCumulative and other optionsenablemaintainermodeTurn on debugging and compile time warnings and load all compiled modulesenablemodsshared=MODULELISTDefines a list of modules to be enabled and build as dynamic shared modules This mean these module have to be loaded dynamically by using the LoadModule directiveMODULELIST is a space separated list of modulenames enclosed by quotation marks The module names are given without the preceding mod For example:enablemodsshared='headers rewrite dav'Additionally you can use the special keywords reallyall all most and few For exampleenablemodsshared=mostwill compile most modules and build them as DSO modulesenablemodsshared=fewwill only compile a very basic set of modulesThe default set is mostThe LoadModule directives for the chosen modules will be automatically generated in the main configuration file By default all those directives will be commented out except for the modules that are either required or explicitly selected by a configure enablefoo argument You can change the set of loaded modules by activating or deactivating the LoadModule directives in apache2conf In addition the LoadModule directives for all built modules can be activated via the configure option enableloadallmodulesenablemodsstatic=MODULELISTThis option behaves similar to enablemodsshared but will link the given modules statically This mean these modules will always be present while running httpd They need not be loaded with LoadModuleenablemodules=MODULELISTThis option behaves like to enablemodsshared and will also link the given modules dynamically The special keyword none disables the build of all modulesenablev4mappedAllow IPv6 sockets to handle IPv4 connectionswithport=PORTThis defines the port on which httpd will listen This port number is used when generating the configuration file apache2conf The default is 80withprogramnameDefine an alternative executable name The default is httpdOptional packagesThese options are used to define optional packagesGeneral syntaxGenerally you can use the following syntax to define an optional package:withPACKAGE=ARGUse the package PACKAGE The default value for ARG is yeswithoutPACKAGEDo not use the package PACKAGE This is the same as withPACKAGE=no This option is provided by autoconf but not very useful for the Apache HTTP ServerSpecific packageswithapr=DIRFILEThe Apache Portable Runtime APR is part of the httpd source distribution and will automatically be build together with the HTTP server If you want to use an already installed APR instead you have to tell configure the path to the aprconfig script You may set the absolute path and name or the directory to the installed APR aprconfig must exist within this directory or the subdirectory binwithaprutil=DIRFILEThe Apache Portable Runtime Utilities APU are part of the httpd source distribution and will automatically be build together with the HTTP server If you want to use an already installed APU instead you have to tell configure the path to the apuconfig script You may set the absolute path and name or the directory to the installed APU apuconfig must exist within this directory or the subdirectory binwithssl=DIRIf modssl has been enabled configure searches for an installed OpenSSL You can set the directory path to the SSLTLS toolkit insteadwithz=DIRconfigure searches automatically for an installed zlib library if your source configuration requires one eg when moddeflate is enabled You can set the directory path to the compression library insteadSeveral features of the Apache HTTP Server including modauthndbm and modrewrite's DBM RewriteMap use simple keyvalue databases for quick lookups of information SDBM is included in the APU so this database is always available If you would like to use other database types use the following options to enable them:withgdbm=pathIf no path is specified configure will search for the include files and libraries of a GNU DBM installation in the usual search paths An explicit path will cause configure to look in pathlib and pathinclude for the relevant files Finally the path may specify specific include and library paths separated by a colonwithndbm=pathLike withgdbm but searches for a New DBM installationwithberkeleydb=pathLike withgdbm but searches for a Berkeley DB installationNoteThe DBM options are provided by the APU and passed through to its configuration script They are useless when using an already installed APU defined by withaprutilYou may use more then one DBM implementation together with your HTTP server The appropriated DBM type will be configured within the runtime configuration at each timeOptions for support programsenablestaticsupportBuild a statically linked version of the support binaries This means a standalone executable will be built with all the necessary libraries integrated Otherwise the support binaries are linked dynamically by defaultenablesuexecUse this option to enable suexec which allows you to set uid and gid for spawned processes Do not use this option unless you understand all the security implications of running a suid binary on your server Further options to configure suexec are described belowIt is possible to create a statically linked binary of a single support program by using the following options:enablestaticabBuild a statically linked version of abenablestaticcheckgidBuild a statically

and giving more power to the government to keep us \u201csafe\u201d from a virus Every day I look around and I see the danger of bureaucratic choices taken without any flexibility or judgment imposed upon the people People protesting or simply expressing an opinion not conforming with the government are censored from the traditional or social media and fined for their respectful protests Few days ago in Milan the owners of restaurants protested peacefully against the lockdown The protester were fined 400 Euros each for illegal gathering This is just an example but every day the same happens and most of the time does not even make the news Some people already decided to give up and suicide because they cannot produce anymore and they have no more a way to survive but are just accumulating debts This situation made me think about what can we do as individuals to keep ourselves free and not fall in the darkness of the European past This week the video is a little longer sorry but I felt the need to express my thinking in a proper way \u2026Read MoreMay 08by Luigi Barbanoin BlogUpdates Film photography Gear Talk Uncategorized 0 commentstags: Film camera film photography filmisalive

Covid lockdown it is the 75th anniversary of the Italian Liberation from the dictatorships that brought us to WWII While now other \u201cleaders\u201d following the same socialist philosophy are establishing a new dictatorship all over Europe with the excuse of a virus and the help of bureaucratic non elected worldwide organizations I decided to homage the real people that freed us I hope they will do it again because Europeans are demonstrating one more time to be just sheep ready to lose all their freedom for the impossible promise of safety Sadly the people\u2019s memory seems to be very short the same mistakes are going to be repeated and the trust is wrongly given to the fascists that wearing now a red shirt rewrote history Personally I have only one creed: Live free or die
